i guess the other aspect for these events, or future events, is what are you doing that is unique to push novel experiences that are different year to year? so it's not the same every time. bring elements of what you've done in the past and build onto it into different areas. how are you reaching out to individuals who are there that primarily go to the snug zone only (like some of my mates)? what service are you providing them? or what kind of participation are you wanting from them as well? keep it innovative. yes, burn principles is about giving back and radical inclusion (etc.) from all participants but this is your fundraiser. how are you making all individuals who come in from different walks of life included? i had a mate who left right from the get go on friday night because he felt he didn't feel represented. yes, it's not an event for everyone but people go because they connected somehow at kiwiburn and want to continue that. he didn't get that here. it's a variety of interactive activities, design, decorations, and flow that helps with it. when you are on top of the game and people look up to you, you have to keep evolving and be creative to push the limits of novel experiences to keep it going. you have to connect on a much wider level."

111,WELL,TRUE,SAT,1,Veteran,D,C,1,6,7,7,long festival,freedom of expression. you guys do such an amazing job and the ticket price is so accessible x,i wasn't a fan of how the performances were done. they felt pretty exclusionary at times and it was unavoidable as everything was parked right in the dance floor. i also don't think enough opportunity was given to burners to perform as opposed to elite female pole dancers who have not attended a burn before for example. and i speak as a maaaad pole dance fan.,i think future burns could benefit from opening up performing slots to the full spectrum of burner individuals (as with the fire show pre burning of the man) as a priority. i also think doing performances before or after certain things (e.g. auckland decompression) or in a different area that doesn't invite spontaneous participation but then shut it down when it occurs would have been nicer for some. e.g. at the back of the dance floor - performing wouldn't be in others 'way' and other people wouldn't be in their way but everyone gets the chance to enjoy what they like. the vibe with the pole for example at kb in the chur camp was super awesome.,thank you so much you guys are all super dope had such a great time ❤️❤️❤️

i thought our greeter did a good job with the “consent is like a cup of tea” chat, but that is because i have come across that metaphor before and find it engaging.

i think for people new to the burner scene who aren’t used to having an up front discussion about consent upon entering a party, it might be better to have clearly articulated guidelines laid out during that discussion (similar to the posters that were all around the venue, which were great!). this is for the sake of clarity and simplicity (although consent shouldn’t be a difficult concept *sigh*) 

i really appreciated the consent guardians being around during the evening too, i always feel safe and supported at burner events, keep doing a great job!"
